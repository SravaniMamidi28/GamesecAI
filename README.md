# GameSecAI
### An Adaptive, AI-Powered Cybersecurity Awareness Platform  

Note:
This platform is part of an academic capstone project.  
It is **not IRB-approved for public research participation**, and the live deployment is intended **solely for faculty review and demonstration.**

---

# Overview
GameSecAI is a browser-based cybersecurity training platform that combines **AI-powered adaptive learning**, **behavioral analytics**, and **gamified threat simulations**.  
It evaluates not just *what* users answer — but *how* they think, react, and behave during cybersecurity decision-making.

GameSecAI integrates:
- Google Gemini AI  
- Firebase Hosting & Firestore  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- Chart.js  
- Real-time behavior tracking
